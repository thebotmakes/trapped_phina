# trapped_phina
This is a halloween scare that me and Phina (4) came up with to scare her mum! Uses an Adafruit Hallowing and a mini speaker and the onboard light sensor, when it's in the dark it plays samples and when it's in the light it flashes the neopixels, displays some images of Phina and plays some different samples.  Customer said - very creepy!
