# trapped_phina
This is a halloween scare that me and Phina (4) came up with to scare her mum! Uses an Adafruit Hallowing and a mini speaker and the onboard light sensor, when it's in the dark it plays samples and when it's in the light it flashes the neopixels, displays some images of Phina and plays some different samples.  Customer said - very creepy!

The samples are just wav files, and the pictures are bitmap - obviously these are very personal to us so not going to upload them, but you can just replace the files with your own!
